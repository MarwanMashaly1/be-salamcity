5;Jami Omar Mosque;3990 Old Richmond Rd, Ottawa, ON K2H 8R5;;jamiomar@jamiomar.org;"We started in the late 1980's to investigate the possibility of establishing a Masjid in the West End of Ottawa to serve the needs of the growing Muslim Community. The idea was to serve the residents of Bayshore, Greenbank - Baseline - Craig Henry corridor, Barrhaven, Bells Corners and Kanata.\n\nIn late 1988, a meeting was called to formalize our efforts and this led to the formation of Jamiatul Muslemeen of Ottawa-Carleton.\n\nA Shuraa was formed to lead the organization. In 1993, the Baptist Bible Church, located at 572 Moodie Dr. came up for sale. It was centrally located for the West End, the property was designated Institutional and there was, adjacent to the property, undeveloped tracts of land that had the potential for purchase and expansion in the future.\n\nWe put in an offer through a Muslim Real Estate agent and after some negotiation; it was accepted by the Church.\n\nAll praise belongs to our Lord and Creator Allah SWT, Who through His Mercy and Will, made it possible for the Shuraa to collect the entire purchase price and the property was bought for cash!!\n\nInitially, we cleaned out the Basement, put in a sub-floor, carpeted it and started the Masjid and Madrasa.";https://www.jamiomar.org/;https://www.facebook.com/jamiatulmuslimeenottawa/;;https://www.instagram.com/jamiomar/;
